# Trypto AI Trip Builder - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Trypto is developing an AI-powered custom trip builder that transforms standard travel website request forms into interactive itinerary builders. This white-label solution enables travel companies to provide immediate, visual trip customization experiences while generating higher-quality leads.

## Problem Statement

Current travel booking process issues:
- **Antiquated request forms**: 90% of travel companies use basic "request a quote" forms
- **Email ping-pong**: Lengthy back-and-forth communication to clarify trip preferences
- **Poor lead quality**: Basic contact forms provide minimal trip details
- **Time-intensive**: Travel operators spend 20+ minutes building initial itineraries
- **Limited engagement**: Customers can't visualize or interact with potential trips

## Product Vision

Transform travel planning from static request forms to dynamic, AI-powered trip builders that allow customers to visualize and customize their ideal journey before connecting with travel operators.

## Target Users

### Primary Users
1. **Travel Company Operators**
   - Custom trip specialists at tour operators
   - Sales teams handling inbound leads
   - Small to medium travel companies (primary focus)

2. **End Travelers** 
   - Customers seeking custom/private trips (not group departures)
   - Budget range: $10,000-$20,000+ trips
   - Family groups, couples, custom group travel

### Secondary Users
3. **Large Travel Corporations**
   - Enterprise clients (Travel Corporation, Intrepid, etc.)
   - Companies transitioning from group to custom travel
