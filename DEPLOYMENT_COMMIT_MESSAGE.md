feat: implement service-oriented architecture with safe deployment strategy

BREAKING CHANGE: New service architecture introduced (disabled by default)

- Implement Domain-Driven Design with clean architecture
- Add Tour service with full CRUD operations
- Integrate real services (Auth, Email, Analytics)
- Create comprehensive monitoring dashboard
- Add feature flags for zero-downtime deployment
- Implement gradual rollout capabilities

Deployment:
- GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployment
- Vercel configuration with environment variables
- Health check and metrics endpoints
- Staging deployments with automatic testing

Migration:
- All components updated to support both old and new implementations
- Feature flags control service usage
- Complete rollback capability maintained
- Performance monitoring and comparison tools

The new service is deployed DISABLED by default. Enable gradually using:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_NEW_TOUR_SERVICE=true
- NEXT_PUBLIC_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE=0-100

See DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for rollout instructions.
