## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Production Deployment (NOW)
```bash
# Deploy with new service DISABLED
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_NEW_TOUR_SERVICE=false
./scripts/deploy-production.sh
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Health check endpoint accessible: `/api/v1/tours/health`
- [ ] Old API still working: `/api/tour-operator/tours`
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard accessible: `/admin/monitoring`

### Step 2: Staging Test
```bash
# Enable in staging environment
cp .env.staging .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_NEW_TOUR_SERVICE=true

# Run tests
npx tsx scripts/test-new-tour-service.ts
npx tsx scripts/performance-comparison.ts
```

**Test Checklist:**
- [ ] Create tour works
- [ ] List tours works
- [ ] Update tour works
- [ ] Publish tour works
- [ ] Archive tour works
- [ ] Email notifications sent
- [ ] Analytics tracked

### Step 3: Gradual Rollout
```bash
# Use the rollout manager
npx tsx scripts/rollout-manager.ts

# Or simulate the rollout
npx tsx scripts/simulate-rollout.ts
```

**Rollout Phases:**
1. **Internal Testing** (Day 1-3)
   - Strategy: `internal`
   - Target: `@tripnav.com` emails only

2. **10% Rollout** (Day 4-7)
   - Strategy: `percentage`
   - Percentage: `10`

3. **50% Rollout** (Week 2)
   - Strategy: `percentage`
   - Percentage: `50`

4. **100% Rollout** (Week 3)
   - Strategy: `all`
   - Percentage: `100`

### Step 4: Monitor Progress

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Response Time: Target < 200ms (p95)
- Error Rate: Target < 0.5%
- User Engagement: Should remain stable
- Support Tickets: No increase

**Monitoring URLs:**
- Health Check: `/api/v1/tours/health`
- Service Metrics: `/api/monitoring/service-metrics`
- Dashboard: `/admin/monitoring`

### Step 5: Complete Migration

After successful 100% rollout:
```bash
# Remove legacy code
./scripts/cleanup-legacy-code.sh
```

## Rollback Procedure

If issues arise at any stage:

1. **Immediate Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Set in environment
   NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_NEW_TOUR_SERVICE=false
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE=0
   
   # Restart application
   ```

2. **Investigate**
   - Check Sentry for errors
   - Review monitoring dashboard
   - Analyze performance metrics

3. **Fix and Retry**
   - Create hotfix
   - Test in staging
   - Resume rollout

## Success Criteria

The migration is successful when:
- [x] Code deployed to production
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Performance improved or neutral
- [ ] Error rate < 0.5%
- [ ] 100% traffic on new service
- [ ] 1 week of stable operation

## Support Resources

- **Monitoring Dashboard**: `/admin/monitoring`
- **Deployment Guide**: `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- **Architecture Docs**: `PROPOSED_SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Rollback Plan**: See above

## Next Steps After Tour Service

Once the Tour service migration is complete, apply the same pattern to:
1. Itinerary Generation Service
2. Lead Management Service
3. User/Operator Service

**Status**: Ready for production deployment with gradual rollout strategy in place.
