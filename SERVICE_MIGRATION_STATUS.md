# TripNav Service Architecture Migration Status

## Current State

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)
- Core infrastructure with dependency injection (inversify)
- Result type for functional error handling
- Domain error classes
- Shared utilities and types

### ✅ Phase 2: Tour Service (COMPLETED)
- **Domain Layer**: Tour aggregate with business logic
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and orchestration
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Prisma repository, real services
- **Presentation Layer**: Controllers and React hooks
- **API Routes**: New versioned endpoints at `/api/v1/tours`

### ✅ Real Service Integrations (COMPLETED)
- NextAuth authentication service
- Resend email service
- Mixed analytics (Google + internal)
- Structured logging with Sentry
- Event-driven architecture with event bus

### ✅ Migration Tooling (COMPLETED)
- Feature flag system for gradual rollout
- Migration scripts and documentation
- Component migration examples
- API route mapping guide

## Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Update Tour Components (Priority: HIGH)
Based on `old_api_usage.txt`, these components need updating:
- `components/tour-operator/TourOperatorDashboard.tsx`
- `components/tour-operator/TourUploadModal.tsx`
- `components/tour-operator/TourImportModal.tsx`
- `components/tour-operator/TourUrlImportModal.tsx`
- `components/tour-operator/TourDetailModal.tsx`

### 2. Add Error Handling UI
- Create error boundary components
- Add retry mechanisms
- Implement user-friendly error messages
- Add loading skeletons

### 3. Test Migration Path
```bash
# 1. Test with feature flag disabled (current behavior)
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_NEW_TOUR_SERVICE=false npm run dev

# 2. Test with feature flag enabled (new service)
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_NEW_TOUR_SERVICE=true npm run dev

# 3. Run integration tests
npm test
```

### 4. Deploy Strategy
1. Deploy code with feature flag disabled
2. Enable for internal team (by user ID)
3. Enable for 10% of users
4. Monitor metrics (response time, errors)
5. Gradually increase to 100%
6. Remove old implementation

## Files to Review

### New Architecture Files:
- `/src/core/` - Core domain and infrastructure
- `/src/infrastructure/` - Service implementations
- `/src/presentation/` - Controllers and hooks
- `/app/api/v1/` - New API routes

### Migration Files:
- `TOUR_API_MIGRATION_MAP.md` - API mapping
- `TOUR_API_MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Step-by-step guide
- `COMPONENT_MIGRATION_EXAMPLE.md` - Component update example
- `COMPONENT_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - General migration patterns

### Configuration:
- `.env.service-migration` - Feature flags template
- `lib/feature-flags.ts` - Feature flag implementation
- `lib/migration/tour-adapter.ts` - Gradual migration adapter

## Monitoring Checklist

During migration, monitor:
- [ ] API response times (new vs old)
- [ ] Error rates in Sentry
- [ ] User engagement metrics
- [ ] Email delivery success
- [ ] Analytics event tracking

## Success Criteria

The migration is successful when:
1. All tour operations use new service architecture
2. No increase in error rates
3. Improved or equal performance
4. All tests passing
5. Feature flag can be removed

## Architecture Benefits Achieved

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic isolated from infrastructure
2. **Testability**: Each layer independently testable
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with DI
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features
5. **Maintainability**: Clear structure and patterns
