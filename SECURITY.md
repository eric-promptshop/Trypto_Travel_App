## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our Travel Itinerary Builder seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### Reporting Process

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: security@example.com

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

After you report a vulnerability:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: We'll assess the vulnerability and its impact
3. **Fix Development**: We'll develop a fix for confirmed vulnerabilities
4. **Testing**: We'll thoroughly test the fix
5. **Release**: We'll release the fix as soon as possible
6. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate disclosure with you

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing to this project, please follow these security guidelines:

### Authentication & Authorization

- Never hardcode credentials or API keys
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper session management
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### Input Validation

```typescript
// Always validate user input
const validateEmail = (email: string): boolean => {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return emailRegex.test(email);
};

// Sanitize data before use
const sanitizeInput = (input: string): string => {
  return input.trim().replace(/<[^>]*>/g, '');
};
```

### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Sanitize all user-generated content

### Dependencies

- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Use `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
- Pin dependency versions in production

### Error Handling

```typescript
// Don't expose sensitive information in errors
try {
  // Some operation
} catch (error) {
  // Log full error internally
  logger.error('Database operation failed', error);
  
  // Return sanitized error to user
  return {
    error: 'An error occurred. Please try again later.',
    code: 'INTERNAL_ERROR'
  };
}
```
