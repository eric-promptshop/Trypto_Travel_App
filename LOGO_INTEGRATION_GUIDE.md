# TripNav Logo Integration Guide

## Manual Steps Required

Since the SVG file in your Downloads folder has permission restrictions, please follow these steps:

### 1. Copy the Logo File

Please manually copy the TripNav.svg file to your project:

```bash
# Option 1: Copy to public directory
cp ~/Downloads/TripNav.svg ~/Documents/travel-itinerary-builder/public/tripnav-logo.svg

# Option 2: If the file is too large, you might want to optimize it first
# You can use an online SVG optimizer like https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/
```

### 2. Verify File Placement

The logo should be placed at:
```
/Users/ericgonzalez/Documents/travel-itinerary-builder/public/tripnav-logo.svg
```

### 3. Update Components

Once the file is in place, I can update the following components:
- TripNavLogo component
- MainHeader
- Landing page hero
- Sign-in page
- Other locations where the logo appears

## Alternative: Use Image Component

If the SVG is too large or complex, we can use Next.js Image component:

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image 
  src="/tripnav-logo.svg" 
  alt="TripNav" 
  width={200} 
  height={50}
  priority
/>
```

## Next Steps

Please:
1. Copy the TripNav.svg file to `public/tripnav-logo.svg`
2. Let me know when it's done
3. I'll update all the components to use the new logo

## Note on SVG Size

307KB is quite large for an SVG logo. Consider:
- Optimizing the SVG using tools like SVGO
- Converting complex illustrations to simpler paths
- Removing unnecessary metadata
- Using a PNG version for complex graphics
