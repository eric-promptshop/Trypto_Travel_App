# CRITICAL: ChunkLoadError Fix

## The Issue
You're experiencing a persistent ChunkLoadError because your browser has cached old webpack chunks that no longer exist.

## IMMEDIATE FIX - Do This Now:

### Option 1: Use a Different Browser
1. Open a **different browser** (Safari, Firefox, Edge) that you haven't used for this project
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000

### Option 2: Force Clear Chrome Cache
1. Open Chrome
2. Press **Cmd+Shift+Delete** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+Delete** (Windows)
3. Select:
   - Time range: **All time**
   - Check: **Cached images and files**
   - Check: **Cookies and other site data**
4. Click **Clear data**
5. Close Chrome completely
6. Reopen and navigate to http://localhost:3000

### Option 3: Use Chrome Incognito with Force Refresh
1. Close ALL Chrome windows
2. Open Chrome in Incognito mode (Cmd+Shift+N)
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
4. If it still shows error, press **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+F5** (Windows)

## What I've Fixed:
1. Simplified the Next.js configuration
2. Removed complex webpack optimizations
3. Simplified the layout.tsx to remove async operations
4. Disabled runtime chunk splitting in development

## To Start Fresh:
```bash
# The app is already running after npm install
# Just clear your browser cache and visit http://localhost:3000
```

## Prevention:
- Always use Incognito mode during development
- Or use different browsers for testing
- Clear cache after any webpack config changes
