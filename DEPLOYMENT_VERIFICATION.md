# Deployment Verification Guide

## ðŸŽ‰ Your changes have been pushed to GitHub!

The service architecture implementation is now deployed. Here's how to verify and proceed:

## 1. Check GitHub Actions

Go to: https://github.com/eric-promptshop/Trypto_Travel_App/actions

You should see:
- "Deploy to Production" workflow running or completed
- All steps should pass (tests, build, deploy)

## 2. Verify in Vercel Dashboard

Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard

Check:
- New deployment triggered by GitHub push
- Build logs show success
- Environment variables are set

## 3. Test Deployed Endpoints

Once deployment completes, test these URLs:

### Health Check (Should work even with service disabled)
```bash
curl https://travel-itinerary-builder.vercel.app/api/v1/tours/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "tour-service",
  "metadata": {
    "featureFlag": false,
    "rolloutPercentage": "0"
  }
}
```

### Old API (Should still work)
```bash
curl https://travel-itinerary-builder.vercel.app/api/tour-operator/tours
```

### Monitoring Dashboard
Visit: https://travel-itinerary-builder.vercel.app/admin/monitoring

## 4. Next Steps

### Create a Test PR for Staging
```bash
git checkout -b test/verify-new-service
echo "# Service Test" > SERVICE_TEST.md
git add SERVICE_TEST.md
git commit -m "test: verify new service in staging"
git push origin test/verify-new-service
```

Then create a PR on GitHub. This will:
- Deploy to staging with service ENABLED
- Allow you to test the new architecture

### Manual Production Rollout (When Ready)

1. Go to: https://github.com/eric-promptshop/Trypto_Travel_App/actions
2. Click "Deploy to Production"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Set:
   - enable_new_service: false
   - rollout_percentage: 10
5. Monitor at: /admin/monitoring

## 5. Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails

1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Verify all secrets are set in GitHub:
   - VERCEL_TOKEN
   - VERCEL_ORG_ID
   - VERCEL_PROJECT_ID

### If Health Check Fails

1. Check Vercel function logs
2. Ensure dependencies are installed (reflect-metadata, inversify)
3. Check build output in Vercel

### Quick Rollback

If needed, in Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables
2. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_NEW_TOUR_SERVICE=false`
3. Redeploy

## Success Checklist

- [ ] GitHub Action completed successfully
- [ ] Vercel deployment succeeded
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] Old APIs still functional
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard accessible
- [ ] No errors in production logs

ðŸš€ **Your service architecture is now live (but safely disabled)!**

The new service won't affect users until you explicitly enable it.
Follow the gradual rollout plan when ready.
