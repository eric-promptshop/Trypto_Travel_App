2. Connect form submissions to database/CRM
3. Build content import functionality
4. Implement real pricing calculations
5. Add lead capture and storage

### Medium Priority
1. Add voice-to-text input option
2. Implement conversational text input
3. Build admin tools for content management
4. Add comprehensive error handling
5. Implement multi-tenant isolation

### Low Priority
1. Add more theme presets
2. Enhance animation effects
3. Build analytics dashboard
4. Add A/B testing framework

## Test Environment Configuration

```env
NODE_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=configured
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=not-configured
```

## Conclusion

The Trypto AI Trip Builder shows excellent potential with a polished UI, strong white-label capabilities, and solid architectural foundation. However, it currently functions more as a UI prototype than a working product. The core value propositions - AI-powered itinerary generation, CRM integration, and dynamic pricing - are not implemented.

**Recommendation:** Do not deploy to production until critical features are implemented.

## Severity Classifications

- **Critical**: Features that block core functionality
- **High**: Important features that significantly impact user experience  
- **Medium**: Nice-to-have features that enhance the product
- **Low**: Polish and optimization items

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize implementing AI itinerary generation
2. Build data persistence layer
3. Complete CRM integration
4. Add content management tools
5. Conduct security audit before production deployment
