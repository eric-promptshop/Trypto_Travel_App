# Travel Itinerary Builder - Redirect Loop Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The application was experiencing a redirect loop to `/itinerary-display` on localhost, preventing users from accessing the home page.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Protected Route Issue**: `/itinerary-display` was marked as a protected route in `middleware.ts`, requiring authentication
2. **Navigation Link**: The route was linked in the `MainNavigation` component
3. **Authentication Loop**: Unauthenticated users trying to access `/itinerary-display` were redirected to signin with a callback URL pointing back to `/itinerary-display`, creating an infinite loop

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Middleware Configuration (`/middleware.ts`)
- **Removed** `/itinerary-display` from the `protectedRoutes` array
- This allows the page to be accessed without authentication

### 2. Navigation Component (`/components/layout/MainNavigation.tsx`)
- **Removed** the navigation item for `/itinerary-display`
- Prevents users from accidentally navigating to this legacy route

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
   - Right-click the refresh button
   - Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
   - Alternatively, use an incognito/private browsing window

2. **Restart the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   # Kill any running instances
   pkill -f "next dev"
   
   # Start fresh
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Application**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000`
   - The home page should load without redirecting

## Application Flow
The correct flow for viewing itineraries is now:
1. Home page (`/`) → User enters travel details
2. Plan page (`/plan`) → AI generates itinerary
3. Trip page (`/plan/[tripId]`) → View and edit the generated itinerary

## Additional Notes
- The `/itinerary-display` page still exists but is now accessible without authentication
- This page expects data from sessionStorage and will show "No Itinerary Found" if accessed directly
- Consider removing the `/app/itinerary-display` folder entirely if this page is no longer needed

## Troubleshooting
If you still experience redirects after applying these fixes:
1. Check for browser extensions that might be interfering
2. Try a different browser or profile
3. Check the browser's network tab for any 302/301 redirects
4. Ensure no local storage or session storage contains redirect URLs

## Files Modified
1. `/middleware.ts` - Removed `/itinerary-display` from protected routes
2. `/components/layout/MainNavigation.tsx` - Removed navigation link to `/itinerary-display`
