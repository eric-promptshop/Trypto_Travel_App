# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Full-Screen Hero Section with Natural Language Input
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Transform the current homepage into an immersive full-screen experience featuring a background video/imagery and a prominent natural language input field with the prompt 'Where is your next story taking you?'
# Details:
Create a responsive full-screen hero section that replaces the current homepage layout. The implementation should include:

1. A high-quality, auto-playing background video or dynamic imagery that evokes travel inspiration (ensure optimized loading and fallbacks for different devices)
2. A centered, prominent natural language input field with the placeholder text 'Where is your next story taking you?'
3. Voice input capability with a microphone icon that activates speech-to-text functionality
4. Subtle animations for user interaction feedback (input field focus, typing effects)
5. Smooth transitions when user submits input, transitioning to the planning interface
6. Ensure the design maintains brand identity while creating an emotional, inspiring atmosphere
7. Implement responsive design to ensure the experience works across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
8. Add subtle UI hints to guide users on how to interact with the natural language input
9. Ensure accessibility compliance (keyboard navigation, screen reader support, appropriate contrast ratios)
10. Implement analytics tracking to measure engagement with the new interface

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both technical functionality and user experience aspects:

1. Cross-browser testing: Verify the hero section renders correctly in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
2. Responsive testing: Confirm proper display and functionality across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports
3. Performance testing: Measure and optimize load time, ensuring background video/imagery loads efficiently without impacting page performance (target First Contentful Paint under 1.5s)
4. Natural language input testing:
   - Test various input phrases and verify they correctly transition to the planning interface
   - Verify placeholder text displays and clears appropriately
   - Test edge cases like empty submissions and very long inputs
5. Voice input testing:
   - Verify microphone activation works across supported browsers
   - Test voice recognition accuracy with different accents and background noise levels
6. Accessibility testing:
   - Verify screen reader compatibility
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
7. Animation and transition testing: Verify smooth animations at different frame rates and device capabilities
8. A/B testing: Compare user engagement metrics between old and new homepage designs
9. User testing: Conduct moderated sessions to gather qualitative feedback on the emotional impact and usability of the new design

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Full-Screen Hero Section with Background Media [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the responsive full-screen hero section with optimized background video/imagery that serves as the foundation for the new homepage experience.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a new component for the full-screen hero section
2. Implement responsive container that fills the viewport (100vh) with appropriate overflow handling
3. Add background video component with:
   - Auto-play, loop, and muted attributes

4. Add keyboard event listeners for submission (Enter key)
5. Implement form validation if needed
6. Ensure proper z-indexing and positioning within the hero section
7. Add appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
8. Implement analytics tracking for input field interactions

Testing approach:
- Test input field behavior across devices and browsers
- Verify keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- Test form submission and validation
- Verify animations and transitions work correctly

## 3. Implement Voice Input Capability with Speech-to-Text [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Add voice input functionality with microphone icon and speech-to-text integration for the natural language input field.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Add microphone icon button adjacent to the text input field
2. Implement speech recognition API integration:
   - Use Web Speech API or appropriate speech recognition library
   - Handle browser compatibility and fallbacks

3. Create visual feedback for voice recording states:
   - Inactive state (default)
   - Listening state (animated microphone icon)
   - Processing state
   - Error state (when permission denied or not supported)
4. Implement the logic to convert speech to text and populate the input field
5. Add appropriate error handling and user feedback
6. Ensure the voice input works seamlessly with the existing text input
