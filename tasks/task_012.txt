4. Simulate expected peak user loads (at least 2x projected maximum)
5. Identify performance bottlenecks under stress
6. Test CDN configuration and caching strategies
7. Analyze database performance under load
8. Test auto-scaling capabilities if applicable
9. Document load testing results and recommendations

Testing approach:
- Start with baseline performance tests
- Gradually increase load to identify breaking points
- Monitor server resources during tests
- Create load testing reports with clear metrics and graphs

## 11. Implement Error Handling and Edge Case Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.6, 12.8
### Description: Test application behavior under error conditions and edge cases to ensure graceful handling.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Identify potential error conditions and edge cases
2. Create test scenarios for network failures
3. Test API error responses and client-side handling
4. Implement tests for boundary conditions in inputs
5. Test with malformed data and unexpected inputs
6. Verify error messages are user-friendly and helpful
7. Test recovery procedures from error states
8. Verify logging of errors for troubleshooting
9. Document all tested edge cases and results

Testing approach:
- Use chaos engineering principles where appropriate
- Simulate various failure modes
- Verify user experience during error conditions
- Create an error handling test matrix

## 12. Create Production Readiness Checklist and Final Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7, 12.8, 12.9, 12.10, 12.11
### Description: Develop and execute a comprehensive production readiness checklist covering all aspects of the application.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a detailed production readiness checklist
2. Verify all critical issues from previous testing are resolved
3. Conduct final performance verification
4. Verify security compliance and remediation
5. Confirm accessibility standards are met
6. Test backup and recovery procedures
7. Verify monitoring and alerting setup
8. Conduct final UAT sign-off with stakeholders
9. Create production deployment plan and rollback procedures
10. Document known issues and workarounds
11. Prepare post-launch monitoring plan

Testing approach:
- Use the checklist for systematic verification
- Involve cross-functional team in final review
- Create a formal sign-off process
- Document the final state of the application with metrics and benchmarks
