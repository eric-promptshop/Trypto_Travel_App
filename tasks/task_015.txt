# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement AI-Generated Skeleton Itinerary with Visual Feedback
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and integrate the AI-generated skeleton itinerary feature that provides instant visual feedback after users input natural language travel requests.
# Details:
This task addresses gap #2 in the PRD implementation. Create a system that processes natural language inputs (e.g., 'I want a 5-day trip to Tokyo with focus on food and culture') and generates a visual skeleton itinerary in real-time. Implementation should include:

1. Natural Language Processing integration to parse user inputs and extract key parameters (location, duration, interests, etc.)
2. AI recommendation engine that generates a day-by-day skeleton itinerary based on extracted parameters
3. Visual representation component that displays the generated itinerary with:
   - Day-by-day breakdown
   - Morning/afternoon/evening time blocks
   - Suggested activities based on interests
   - Estimated travel times between locations
   - Placeholder images representing activities/locations
4. Loading/transition animations to indicate processing
5. Error handling for ambiguous or impossible requests
6. Ability to regenerate or refine the itinerary based on additional input

The UI should update within 3 seconds of input submission to provide the perception of instant feedback, even if it's showing a preliminary version while more detailed results load. Ensure the skeleton itinerary is clearly labeled as AI-generated and can be edited by the user in subsequent steps.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both technical functionality and user experience aspects:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test NLP component with various input phrases and verify correct parameter extraction
   - Verify AI recommendation engine produces valid itineraries for different locations and durations
   - Test rendering of visual components with various data inputs

2. Integration Tests:
   - Verify end-to-end flow from user input to displayed itinerary
   - Test response times under various network conditions
   - Validate error handling with edge case inputs

3. User Experience Tests:
   - Conduct A/B testing with different visual feedback styles
   - Measure time from input submission to first meaningful display
   - Track user engagement metrics (time spent viewing itinerary, interaction rate)
   - Gather qualitative feedback on the relevance and quality of generated itineraries

4. Specific Test Cases:
   - Simple request: "Weekend trip to San Francisco"
   - Complex request: "10-day family vacation in Europe covering Paris, London and Rome with kids activities and some museum visits"
   - Ambiguous request: "Somewhere warm for a week"
   - Invalid request: "Trip to Mars next weekend"

Pass criteria: 90% of test users should receive a visually rendered skeleton itinerary within 3 seconds of input submission, and 85% should rate the generated itinerary as relevant to their request.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Natural Language Processing for Travel Request Parsing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a service that processes natural language travel requests and extracts structured parameters needed for itinerary generation
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Set up an NLP service using a library like spaCy or integrate with a cloud NLP API (e.g., Google NLP, Azure Language Understanding)
2. Develop entity extraction logic to identify key travel parameters: location, duration, interests, budget, travel style, etc.
3. Create a validation system to handle ambiguous inputs and request clarification
4. Implement a parameter normalization process to standardize extracted data (e.g., mapping 'Tokyo' to a specific location ID)
5. Build a response formatter that converts extracted parameters into a structured format for the recommendation engine
6. Add logging for failed parsing attempts to improve the system

Testing approach:
- Unit test with various sample inputs covering different travel scenarios
- Validate extraction accuracy for each parameter type
- Test error handling with ambiguous or incomplete requests

## 2. Develop AI Recommendation Engine for Skeleton Itinerary Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Build a recommendation system that generates day-by-day skeleton itineraries based on extracted travel parameters
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design a data model for skeleton itineraries (days, time blocks, activities, travel times)
2. Create an algorithm to distribute activities across days based on interests and location proximity
3. Implement time allocation logic to ensure realistic scheduling (morning/afternoon/evening blocks)
4. Add travel time estimation between locations using mapping APIs
5. Develop a scoring system to prioritize activities based on user interests
6. Implement caching for common destinations to improve response time
7. Create fallback recommendations for cases with limited data

Testing approach:
- Test with various parameter combinations to ensure diverse itineraries
- Validate time allocations are realistic and follow logical patterns
- Benchmark performance to ensure recommendations generate within time constraints
- Compare generated itineraries against human-created ones for quality assessment

## 3. Build Visual Representation Component for Itinerary Display [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Create a responsive UI component that visually displays the generated skeleton itinerary with day-by-day breakdown and placeholder imagery
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design and implement a responsive grid layout for the itinerary display
2. Create components for day cards, time blocks, and activity items
3. Implement placeholder image selection logic based on activity types
4. Add visual indicators for travel times between locations
5. Design and implement loading/transition animations
6. Create a visual distinction for AI-generated content vs. user-modified content
7. Ensure accessibility compliance for all visual elements

Testing approach:
- Test responsive behavior across device sizes
- Validate rendering performance with large itineraries
- Conduct usability testing to ensure information hierarchy is clear
- Test animation performance on lower-end devices

## 4. Implement Real-time Feedback System with Progressive Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3
### Description: Create a system that provides immediate visual feedback while progressively enhancing the itinerary as more detailed results become available
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Implement a state management system to track processing stages
2. Create a preliminary results generator that can produce basic feedback within 1 second
3. Develop a progressive enhancement pipeline that updates the display as more detailed results become available
4. Add visual indicators for processing status (e.g., skeleton screens, progress indicators)
5. Implement debouncing for user inputs to prevent excessive processing
6. Create smooth transitions between processing states

Testing approach:
- Measure time to first visual feedback across various request complexities
- Test concurrent request handling
- Validate that UI remains responsive during processing
- Test network degradation scenarios to ensure graceful handling

## 5. Develop Itinerary Refinement and Error Handling System [pending]

7. Implement undo/redo functionality for itinerary changes

Testing approach:
- Test various refinement scenarios to ensure appropriate updates
- Validate error messages are helpful and actionable
- Test edge cases like conflicting preferences or impossible constraints
- Conduct user testing to ensure the refinement flow is intuitive
