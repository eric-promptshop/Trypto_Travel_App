# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement User Feedback and Review System with Social Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a comprehensive user feedback and review system that includes social features such as likes, comments, sharing, and user interactions.
# Details:
Create a modular review system that allows users to rate products/services on a 5-star scale and write detailed reviews. The system should include:

1. Review submission form with text input, star rating, and optional media upload (photos/videos)
2. Review moderation queue for administrators to approve/reject submissions
3. Social interaction features including:
   - Like/upvote functionality for reviews
   - Comment threads on reviews
   - Share options for popular social platforms (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
   - Follow reviewers functionality
4. Notification system to alert users when:
   - Their review receives likes/comments
   - Someone they follow posts a new review
   - A review is approved/rejected
5. User profile pages showing review history and social activity
6. Analytics dashboard for tracking review metrics

The implementation should use React for the frontend components, Redux for state management, and RESTful API endpoints for backend communication. Ensure proper data validation, XSS protection, and rate limiting to prevent abuse. The database schema should include tables for reviews, comments, likes, user relationships, and notifications with appropriate indexes for performance.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should cover all aspects of the review system:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test review submission validation logic
   - Test rating calculation functions
   - Test notification generation logic
   - Test permission checks for editing/deleting reviews

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test the review submission flow end-to-end
   - Test moderation approval/rejection process
   - Test social interaction flows (like, comment, share)
   - Test notification delivery

3. UI Tests:
   - Verify review form validation and error messages
   - Test responsive design on various screen sizes
   - Verify accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
   - Test social feature buttons and interactions

4. Performance Tests:
   - Load test with simulated high volume of reviews/comments
   - Test database query performance with large datasets
   - Measure and optimize page load times for review-heavy pages

5. Security Tests:
   - Test for XSS vulnerabilities in review content display
   - Verify proper authentication for review actions
   - Test rate limiting for review submissions
   - Verify privacy controls for user data

Create a test environment with seed data of various review types. Document test cases in the test management system with clear pass/fail criteria.
