# Task ID: 7
# Title: CRM Integration Development
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the connectors and data pipelines to integrate with major CRM systems and deliver complete itinerary data.
# Details:
Develop API integrations for HubSpot, Salesforce, and Zoho CRM platforms. Create a webhook system for real-time data transfer. Build email template generation for non-CRM users. Implement lead quality scoring based on itinerary completeness and user engagement. Design data formatting adapters for CRM compatibility. Create a unified integration interface that abstracts the differences between CRM systems. Implement secure authentication for all integrations. Build logging and monitoring for integration health.

# Test Strategy:
Test integrations with sandbox environments for each CRM platform. Verify data accuracy and completeness in CRM records. Test webhook reliability under various network conditions. Validate email template rendering across email clients. Conduct end-to-end testing of the lead creation process.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design CRM Integration Interface and Data Models [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a unified abstract interface and data models that will serve as the foundation for all CRM integrations
### Details:
1. Define a common interface (ICrmIntegration) with methods for authentication, data pushing/pulling, and webhook handling
2. Create data models for itinerary information that will be shared across all CRM systems
3. Design adapter interfaces for transforming between internal data format and CRM-specific formats
4. Implement a CrmIntegrationFactory that will return the appropriate implementation based on CRM type
5. Document the interface with clear examples of usage
6. Test by creating mock implementations that validate the interface design

<info added on 2025-06-02T03:32:07.515Z>
The ICrmIntegration interface includes authentication methods (connect(), disconnect(), validateCredentials()), data operations (pushItinerary(), pullContacts(), syncData()), and webhook handlers (registerWebhook(), processWebhookEvent()). 

The data models implement proper serialization/deserialization with JSON annotations and include:
- CrmContact: with fields for name, email, phone, company, custom fields map
- CrmLead: with status, source, value, associated contacts, and conversion probability
- CrmItineraryData: with travel details, pricing, booking status, and related contacts

The BaseConnector abstract class provides:
- Default error handling and retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- Logging of all API interactions
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Rate limiting protection

The CrmIntegrationFactory uses a configuration-driven approach with dependency injection to instantiate the appropriate connector based on:
- CRM type (enum: SALESFORCE, HUBSPOT, ZOHO, DYNAMICS)
- Authentication method (OAuth, API key, username/password)
- Environment (production, sandbox)

Added unit tests with mock HTTP responses for each interface method to validate the design.

## 2. Implement Mock CRM Connectors [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create placeholder implementations for HubSpot, Salesforce, and Zoho CRM connectors that implement the unified interface
### Details:
1. Create mock implementations for each CRM system (HubSpotConnector, SalesforceConnector, ZohoConnector) that implement the ICrmIntegration interface
2. Implement placeholder authentication methods that simulate successful auth flows
3. Add logging to track method calls for debugging
4. Create sample response data that mimics real CRM responses
5. Implement configuration options for each connector
6. Test each connector with unit tests to verify they conform to the interface

<info added on 2025-06-02T03:35:36.909Z>
For each mock connector:

1. **BaseCrmConnector Implementation Details**:
   - Added abstract methods for `getAuthHeaders()` and `formatResponse()`
   - Implemented shared rate limiting logic with configurable thresholds
   - Created connection pooling mechanism for simulated API calls

2. **Authentication Simulation**:
   - HubSpot: Implemented OAuth2 flow with refresh token handling
   - Salesforce: Added JWT bearer token authentication simulation
   - Zoho: Created API key + secret authentication pattern

3. **Response Simulation Improvements**:
   - Added 50ms-200ms random latency to simulate real-world conditions
   - Implemented occasional error responses (rate limits, auth failures)
   - Created paginated response handling for list operations

4. **Storage Implementation**:
   - Added in-memory data store with JSON persistence option
   - Implemented CRUD operations with proper error handling
   - Created data seeding mechanism with configurable entity counts

5. **Image API Fix**:
   - Corrected endpoint URL format from `/api/v1/image/{id}` to `/api/v2/images/{id}`
   - Added proper content-type headers for image responses
   - Implemented thumbnail generation simulation

## 3. Build Webhook Handler System [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop a simple webhook system for simulating real-time data transfer between the application and CRM systems
### Details:
1. Create webhook endpoint controllers for receiving CRM callbacks
2. Implement a webhook registration system to track active webhooks
3. Build a webhook dispatcher for sending data to CRM systems
4. Create a simple event system to trigger webhook events
5. Add security validation for incoming webhooks
6. Test webhook system with mock HTTP requests and verify correct event handling

<info added on 2025-06-02T03:38:14.185Z>
The webhook handler system has been enhanced with the following implementation details:

- WebhookService implemented as a singleton pattern for centralized webhook management across the application
- Event queuing system using Redis for reliable message delivery with configurable TTL
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff (3 attempts, starting at 5s intervals)
- Webhook endpoint at /api/webhooks/crm supports multiple CRM platforms via path parameters (/api/webhooks/crm/:provider)
- Implemented HMAC-based signature validation for secure webhook verification
- Added support for webhook challenge-response verification flow required by some CRMs
- Created webhook registration database schema with fields for endpoint URL, secret key, and event types
- Implemented webhook payload transformation layer to normalize data between different CRM formats
- Added comprehensive logging for webhook events with correlation IDs for request tracing
