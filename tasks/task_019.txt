# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Automated Lead Trigger System for Traveler Tour Interactions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a system that automatically generates qualified leads when travelers interact with tours by viewing, bookmarking, or adding them to itineraries, with intelligent scoring and routing to relevant tour operators.
# Details:
Create an event-driven architecture that captures and processes traveler interactions with tour content across the platform. The system should:

1. Track three primary interaction types:
   - Tour page views (lowest value)
   - Tour bookmarks/saves (medium value)
   - Tour additions to itinerary (highest value)

2. Implement a lead scoring algorithm that:
   - Assigns weighted values to different interaction types
   - Considers frequency and recency of interactions
   - Factors in user profile data (travel history, preferences)
   - Calculates a final lead quality score (0-100)

3. Build a routing mechanism that:
   - Identifies the appropriate tour operator(s) for each lead
   - Filters leads based on minimum quality threshold (configurable)
   - Prevents duplicate lead submissions
   - Delivers leads via API to the existing lead database

4. Create a notification system for tour operators that:
   - Alerts them of new qualified leads
   - Provides lead details and quality score
   - Allows configuration of notification preferences

5. Implement analytics tracking to measure:
   - Lead generation rates by interaction type
   - Conversion rates from leads to bookings
   - Tour operator engagement with leads

Technical requirements:
- Use event listeners for real-time interaction tracking
- Implement queuing system for reliable lead processing
- Ensure GDPR/privacy compliance with user data
- Design for scalability to handle peak traffic periods

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Verify event listeners correctly capture all interaction types
   - Test lead scoring algorithm with various interaction patterns
   - Validate routing logic assigns leads to correct tour operators
   - Ensure notification system delivers alerts properly

2. Integration Testing:
   - Confirm end-to-end flow from user interaction to lead database entry
   - Test API connections to lead database under load conditions
   - Verify proper handling of edge cases (duplicate interactions, system downtime)

3. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create test accounts for tour operators to verify lead quality
   - Simulate traveler journeys with various interaction patterns
   - Validate lead scoring matches expected quality outcomes

4. Performance Testing:
   - Simulate high-volume interaction scenarios (1000+ simultaneous users)
   - Measure system response times and resource utilization
   - Test recovery from failure scenarios

5. Validation Metrics:
   - System should process 99% of interactions within 5 seconds
   - Lead scoring algorithm should demonstrate 85%+ correlation with actual booking likelihood
   - Tour operators should receive notifications within 2 minutes of lead qualification
   - False positive rate (low-quality leads marked as high-quality) should be under 10%

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Event Tracking System for Traveler Tour Interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an event-driven architecture to capture and track traveler interactions with tour content across the platform, including page views, bookmarks, and itinerary additions.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Define event schemas for each interaction type (tour views, bookmarks, itinerary additions)
2. Implement event listeners on frontend components that trigger these interactions
3. Create a backend API endpoint to receive and validate interaction events
4. Set up a queuing system (e.g., RabbitMQ, AWS SQS) to handle event processing reliably
5. Implement a data storage solution for persisting interaction events
6. Add GDPR compliance features including consent tracking and data anonymization options
7. Create logging and monitoring for event capture reliability

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for event validation logic
- Integration tests for event capture from frontend to queue
- Load testing to ensure system handles peak traffic
- Verify proper data storage and retrieval of events

## 2. Develop Lead Scoring Algorithm and Qualification System [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Build a scoring algorithm that evaluates traveler interactions and profile data to calculate lead quality scores, with configurable thresholds for lead qualification.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design scoring model with weighted values for different interaction types (views, bookmarks, itinerary additions)
2. Implement recency and frequency factors in the scoring algorithm
3. Create integration with user profile service to incorporate travel history and preferences
4. Develop the core scoring algorithm that calculates a 0-100 quality score
5. Build a configuration system for adjustable scoring weights and qualification thresholds
6. Implement duplicate detection to prevent multiple leads for the same user-tour combination
7. Create unit tests and validation for the scoring algorithm

Testing approach:
- Unit tests with various interaction combinations to verify scoring logic
- Integration tests with user profile service
- A/B testing framework to compare different scoring models
- Performance testing for algorithm efficiency with large datasets

## 3. Build Tour Operator Notification and Lead Routing System [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Create a system that routes qualified leads to appropriate tour operators and delivers notifications about new leads through configurable channels.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Implement tour operator matching logic to identify relevant operators for each lead
2. Create a notification service supporting multiple channels (email, SMS, in-app, API webhooks)
3. Build notification templates with lead details and quality score information
4. Develop a preference management system for tour operators to configure notification settings
5. Implement rate limiting and batching for notifications to prevent overwhelming operators
6. Create an API for tour operators to acknowledge receipt of leads
7. Set up monitoring for notification delivery success rates

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for operator matching logic
- Integration tests for notification delivery across channels
- End-to-end tests for the complete lead qualification to notification flow
- User acceptance testing with sample tour operators

## 4. Implement CRM Integration and Analytics Dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2, 19.3
### Description: Develop integration with existing lead database/CRM and create an analytics dashboard to track lead generation, conversion rates, and system performance.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design and implement API integration with existing lead database/CRM system
2. Create data models for storing lead analytics and conversion tracking
3. Implement ETL processes to aggregate lead data for reporting
4. Build analytics dashboard with visualizations for key metrics:
   - Lead generation rates by interaction type
