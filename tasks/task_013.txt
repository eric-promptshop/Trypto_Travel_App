# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement AI-Powered Dynamic Hero Section with Trip Countdown
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and develop an engaging, personalized hero section for the travel itinerary page that includes a trip countdown and adapts to user context.
# Details:
Create a responsive hero section at the top of the itinerary page that serves as the emotional anchor for the user's trip planning experience. The hero section should:

1. Display a high-quality, destination-specific background image that changes based on the trip location and time of year
2. Include a personalized greeting that references the user by name and their destination (e.g., "Emma, your Tokyo adventure begins in...")
3. Feature a prominent, visually appealing countdown timer showing days/hours/minutes until trip departure
4. Implement a weather preview showing current and forecasted conditions at the destination
5. Display 1-2 dynamic, AI-generated suggestions relevant to the trip timing (e.g., "Pack an umbrella - rain is expected during your stay")
6. Include subtle animations that bring the section to life without being distracting
7. Ensure the hero section is fully responsive and optimized for all device sizes
8. Implement a system to refresh weather and suggestion data every 3 hours
9. Add a small, tasteful indicator when AI is generating new content
10. Include a quick-action button to jump to the conversational AI assistant

The implementation should use modern front-end frameworks, follow accessibility best practices, and optimize for performance. The AI suggestions should be powered by our recommendation API with appropriate error handling for service disruptions.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the technical implementation and user experience aspects:

1. **Visual Testing**:
   - Verify the hero section renders correctly across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Confirm animations work smoothly and don't impact performance
   - Check that the countdown timer updates correctly

2. **Functional Testing**:
   - Verify personalization works by testing with different user profiles and destinations
   - Confirm weather data refreshes at the expected intervals
   - Test that AI suggestions are contextually relevant to the destination and timing
   - Verify all interactive elements respond correctly to user input

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure and benchmark load time of the hero section
   - Verify the section doesn't negatively impact overall page performance
   - Test behavior under poor network conditions

4. **User Testing**:
   - Conduct A/B testing comparing the new hero section with the current design
   - Gather qualitative feedback on the emotional impact and usefulness of the dynamic content
   - Track engagement metrics including time spent viewing the hero section

5. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Verify the section meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
   - Test with screen readers to ensure all dynamic content is properly announced

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Responsive Hero Section Layout with Destination-Specific Background [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the foundational responsive layout for the hero section that adapts to all device sizes and implements the destination-specific background image system.
### Details:
Implement a responsive container using modern CSS (Flexbox/Grid) with the following components: 1) Create a hero container with relative positioning that maintains proper aspect ratio across devices. 2) Implement an image loading system that selects high-quality, destination-specific images based on trip location and season. 3) Add a semi-transparent overlay for text readability. 4) Set up image optimization with responsive sizes, lazy loading, and WebP format support. 5) Implement graceful fallbacks for image loading failures. 6) Ensure semantic HTML structure with proper accessibility attributes. 7) Test across multiple device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) to verify responsiveness. Use the background-image CSS property with object-fit: cover for proper scaling, and implement media queries for different device sizes.

## 2. Implement Personalized Greeting and Trip Countdown Timer [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create a personalized greeting component that addresses the user by name and references their destination, along with an animated countdown timer showing days/hours/minutes until trip departure.
### Details:
1) Develop a greeting component that dynamically inserts the user's name and destination using template literals. 2) Create a countdown timer component using React hooks (useState, useEffect) or equivalent in your framework. 3) Implement date calculation logic using Day.js or date-fns to compute the time difference between current date and trip departure. 4) Set up a timer that updates every second to show days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining. 5) Add smooth animations for number transitions using CSS transitions or Framer Motion. 6) Implement different display states based on trip timing (upcoming, imminent, in progress, completed). 7) Add appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility. 8) Include unit tests for date calculations and component rendering. The countdown should use requestAnimationFrame for performance and include cleanup on component unmount to prevent memory leaks.

## 3. Develop Weather Preview Component with Real-time Data Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create a weather preview component that displays current and forecasted conditions at the destination with regular data refresh functionality.
### Details:
1) Set up API integration with a weather service (OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.) to fetch current and forecasted weather for the destination. 2) Create a visually appealing weather component showing temperature, conditions, and multi-day forecast. 3) Implement weather icons that match the conditions (sunny, rainy, etc.). 4) Add a data refresh mechanism that updates weather information every 3 hours using a background fetch. 5) Implement proper error handling and loading states for API calls. 6) Add a last-updated timestamp. 7) Ensure the component is responsive and maintains visual harmony with the hero section. 8) Implement caching to reduce API calls and improve performance. 9) Add unit tests for API integration and component rendering. Use a service worker or React Query for efficient background data fetching and implement graceful degradation if weather data is unavailable.

## 4. Implement AI-Generated Trip Suggestions with Visual Indicator [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.3
### Description: Develop the system for generating and displaying 1-2 dynamic, contextually relevant AI suggestions with a tasteful loading/generating indicator.
### Details:
1) Set up integration with the recommendation API to fetch AI-generated suggestions based on trip timing, destination, and weather conditions. 2) Create a component to display suggestions with appropriate styling and icons (e.g., umbrella for rain warnings). 3) Implement a subtle animation or visual indicator that shows when AI is generating new content. 4) Add a refresh mechanism that updates suggestions every 3 hours alongside weather data. 5) Implement proper error handling for API failures with fallback content. 6) Ensure suggestions are relevant to current context by passing appropriate parameters to the API. 7) Add analytics tracking to measure suggestion relevance and user engagement. 8) Implement A/B testing capability to optimize suggestion presentation. 9) Create unit tests for the suggestion component and integration tests for the API. Use a throttling mechanism to prevent excessive API calls and implement a queue system for suggestion updates to ensure smooth user experience.

## 5. Add Subtle Animations and Quick-Action AI Assistant Button [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.4
### Description: Implement subtle animations throughout the hero section and add a quick-action button that jumps to the conversational AI assistant.
### Details:
1) Add subtle background animations that respond to user interaction (parallax effect, gentle movement). 2) Implement smooth transitions between states (loading, data refresh, etc.) using CSS transitions or animation libraries like Framer Motion or GSAP. 3) Create a visually distinct quick-action button that jumps to the conversational AI assistant. 4) Implement scroll behavior for the jump-to-assistant functionality. 5) Add hover and focus states for interactive elements. 6) Ensure all animations respect user preferences for reduced motion. 7) Optimize animations for performance using requestAnimationFrame and CSS will-change property where appropriate. 8) Implement entrance animations when the hero section first loads. 9) Add unit tests for animation triggers and behavior. 10) Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible and have appropriate ARIA attributes. Use the prefers-reduced-motion media query to respect user accessibility settings and implement performance monitoring to ensure animations don't impact page performance.
