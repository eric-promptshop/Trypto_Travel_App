# Task ID: 14
# Title: Modernize ThreeColumnItineraryBuilder UI with 21stdev Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Redesign and implement the main itinerary builder interface using modern 21stdev UI components and interaction patterns to create a more fluid, responsive user experience.
# Details:
This task involves a comprehensive UI modernization of the ThreeColumnItineraryBuilder component:

1. Replace the current day timeline with a modern interactive Gantt/timeline component that:
   - Shows activities with proper time scaling
   - Supports drag-and-drop for rescheduling
   - Provides visual indicators for activity duration
   - Includes smooth animations when adding/removing items

2. Update all UI elements to use 21stdev primitives:
   - Convert all cards to use the modern Card component with proper spacing and shadows
   - Replace badges with the new Badge component supporting appropriate status colors
   - Update all buttons to use the Button component with proper variants (primary, secondary, text)
   - Implement consistent hover and active states across all interactive elements

3. Make key actions visually prominent:
   - Redesign 'Add Day' button as a prominent floating action button or highlighted button
   - Create a visually distinct 'Make Changes' action with animation feedback
   - Add micro-interactions (subtle animations) for all primary actions

4. Ensure responsive layout:
   - Implement proper grid-based layout that adapts to different screen sizes
   - Ensure column widths adjust appropriately on smaller screens
   - Maintain usability on tablet-sized devices
   - Consider collapsible panels for mobile views

5. Implement smooth transitions:
   - Add entrance/exit animations when adding or removing days
   - Include loading states and transitions between major UI changes
   - Ensure all interactions have appropriate feedback animations

The implementation should follow the 21stdev design system documentation for spacing, typography, color usage, and interaction patterns. Ensure accessibility standards are maintained throughout the redesign.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the visual modernization and functional improvements:

1. Visual Regression Testing:
   - Capture screenshots of the old UI and compare with new implementation
   - Verify all components match 21stdev design specifications (spacing, colors, typography)
   - Test across multiple viewport sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)

2. Interaction Testing:
   - Verify all animations work smoothly (add day, make changes, timeline updates)
   - Test drag-and-drop functionality in the timeline component
   - Ensure hover and active states appear correctly on all interactive elements
   - Validate that all micro-interactions trigger appropriately

3. Responsive Testing:
   - Test layout at standard breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px)
   - Verify content remains accessible and usable at all sizes
   - Ensure no horizontal scrolling occurs on standard device sizes

4. Accessibility Testing:
   - Verify proper contrast ratios are maintained
   - Test keyboard navigation through all interactive elements
   - Ensure screen readers can properly interpret all UI elements
   - Validate that animations respect reduced motion preferences

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and compare render times before and after changes
   - Verify smooth performance when adding/removing multiple days
   - Test animation performance on lower-end devices

Create a test plan document with before/after screenshots and results of all test categories.

# Component Exploration and Implementation Strategy

## Existing Component Analysis
- `DayTimeline.tsx` has robust functionality but outdated visuals
- `ModernDayTimeline.tsx` has better aesthetics but lacks full data integration
- Other timeline implementations exist but serve different purposes

## Technical Implementation Approach
1. **Component Architecture**:
   - Create a composable pattern with `TimelineContainer`, `TimelineTrack`, `TimelineItem`, and `TimelineMarker` components
   - Implement context provider for timeline configuration and state management
   - Use compound component pattern for flexible composition

2. **Time Scaling Algorithm**:
   ```typescript
   const calculateTimePosition = (time: string, scale: number): number => {
     const [hours, minutes] = time.split(':').map(Number);
     const totalMinutes = hours * 60 + minutes;
     return (totalMinutes / 1440) * scale; // 1440 = minutes in day
   };
   ```

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement virtualization for large datasets using `react-window` or `react-virtualized`
   - Use `React.memo` for timeline items to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Batch updates for drag operations to maintain 60fps

4. **Accessibility Enhancements**:
   - Implement ARIA roles: `grid` for timeline, `row`/`gridcell` for items
   - Add keyboard shortcuts: arrow keys for navigation, space/enter for selection
   - Include screen reader announcements for timeline changes

5. **Animation Strategy**:
   - Use CSS transitions for position changes during drag
   - Implement Framer Motion's `AnimatePresence` for add/remove animations
   - Create staggered animations for initial timeline load

## Integration Plan
1. Create new component in isolation with storybook examples
2. Implement core functionality with mock data
3. Gradually replace existing timeline while maintaining feature parity
4. Add new capabilities once base functionality is stable
