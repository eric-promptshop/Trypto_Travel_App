# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Magic Edit Feature for Natural Language Itinerary Modifications
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a feature that allows users to modify their itineraries using natural language commands via voice or text input, with visual feedback showing the changes.
# Details:
Create a 'Magic Edit' system that processes natural language requests to modify existing itineraries. The implementation should:

1. Build a natural language processing pipeline that:
   - Identifies modification intents (add, remove, move, extend, shorten)
   - Extracts key entities (locations, activities, dates, times)
   - Maps these to specific itinerary operations

2. Develop modification operations for common scenarios:
   - Adding/removing days to specific locations
   - Moving activities to different times/days
   - Extending/shortening stays
   - Adding/removing activities
   - Reordering activities

3. Implement a confirmation flow that:
   - Shows a preview of changes before applying them
   - Highlights what will be modified in the itinerary
   - Allows users to confirm, reject, or refine the changes

4. Create visual feedback mechanisms:
   - Animate transitions between old and new itinerary states
   - Highlight modified elements
   - Provide before/after views for complex changes

5. Handle edge cases:
   - Conflicting modifications
   - Ambiguous requests
   - Impossible modifications (e.g., scheduling conflicts)
   - Graceful fallbacks when intent cannot be determined

6. Integrate with existing AI chat functionality to maintain conversation context

7. Support both voice input (with speech-to-text conversion) and direct text input

Technical considerations:
- Use a state management approach that allows for undoing changes
- Ensure modifications maintain itinerary integrity and logical consistency
- Optimize NLP processing for common travel-related terminology

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the NLP understanding and the correct application of modifications:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test NLP intent recognition with various phrasings of common modifications
   - Verify entity extraction for locations, activities, dates, and times
   - Test each modification operation in isolation
   - Validate state management and undo functionality

2. Integration Tests:
   - Verify end-to-end flow from natural language input to itinerary changes
   - Test handling of ambiguous requests and confirmation flows
   - Validate visual feedback mechanisms

3. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create a test suite of 20+ common modification scenarios:
     * "Add another day in Paris"
     * "Move the Louvre visit to Tuesday afternoon"
     * "Remove the dinner reservation on Thursday"
     * "Extend my stay in Rome by 2 days"
     * "Add a museum visit on Monday morning"
   - Verify each scenario produces the expected modifications

4. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test with conflicting requests (e.g., scheduling two activities at the same time)
   - Test with impossible requests (e.g., adding activities to days that don't exist)
   - Verify graceful handling of unrecognized commands

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure response time from command to preview generation
   - Test with large, complex itineraries to ensure performance

6. Accessibility Testing:
   - Verify voice input works across different accents and speech patterns
   - Ensure visual feedback is accessible to users with visual impairments

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Natural Language Processing Pipeline for Itinerary Modifications [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build a robust NLP pipeline that can parse user input (text), identify modification intents, extract relevant entities, and map them to specific itinerary operations.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create an NLP service that processes text input and identifies modification intents (add, remove, move, extend, shorten)
2. Implement entity extraction for travel-specific elements (locations, activities, dates, times, durations)
3. Develop intent classification models or rules to categorize user requests into specific modification types
4. Create a mapping layer that converts NLP output into structured operation commands for the itinerary system
5. Build a validation system to detect ambiguous or incomplete requests
6. Implement context awareness to handle references to previous items in conversation
7. Create unit tests with sample modification requests and expected parsed outputs
8. Test with a variety of phrasings and edge cases to ensure robust recognition

Testing approach:
- Create a comprehensive test suite with sample inputs and expected parsed outputs
- Include edge cases like ambiguous requests, complex modifications, and unusual phrasings
- Implement automated tests for intent classification accuracy
- Conduct user testing with sample phrases to measure recognition accuracy

## 2. Develop Itinerary Modification Engine with Operation Handlers [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Create the core modification engine that can apply various operations to an existing itinerary while maintaining logical consistency and handling scheduling conflicts.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Design a set of atomic modification operations (add/remove/move activities, extend/shorten stays, reorder items)
2. Implement handlers for each operation type that can modify the itinerary data structure
3. Create a state management system that tracks original and modified itinerary states
4. Develop conflict detection logic to identify scheduling impossibilities or logical inconsistencies
5. Implement resolution strategies for common conflicts (auto-adjusting times, suggesting alternatives)
6. Build a transaction-like system that allows for previewing changes before committing them
7. Create an undo/redo capability for modifications
8. Ensure all operations maintain itinerary integrity (no overlapping activities, logical travel sequences)

Testing approach:
- Unit test each operation handler with various scenarios
- Create integration tests that simulate complex modification sequences
- Test edge cases like conflicting modifications and boundary conditions
- Verify that the state management correctly tracks changes and allows for reverting

## 3. Implement Voice Input Integration and Speech-to-Text Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Add voice input capabilities to allow hands-free editing of itineraries, including speech recognition, audio processing, and integration with the NLP pipeline.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Integrate a speech-to-text API or library (e.g., Web Speech API, Google Speech-to-Text)
2. Implement audio recording and processing for voice input
3. Create a voice activation system with appropriate UI indicators
4. Build audio feedback mechanisms to confirm voice commands are being processed
5. Develop noise filtering and speech enhancement for better recognition in various environments
6. Connect speech-to-text output to the existing NLP pipeline
7. Implement fallback mechanisms for low-confidence speech recognition results
8. Add voice command examples and help documentation for users

Testing approach:
- Test speech recognition accuracy with different accents and background noise levels
- Verify integration with the NLP pipeline using recorded voice samples
- Conduct usability testing for the voice activation interface
- Test performance on different devices and in various acoustic environments

## 4. Create Visual Feedback System for Itinerary Modifications [pending]

### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Design and implement a modification preview UI that shows proposed changes
2. Create animations for transitions between original and modified itinerary states
3. Develop visual highlighting for added, removed, or modified elements
