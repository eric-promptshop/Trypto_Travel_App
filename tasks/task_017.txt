# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Tour Discovery and Integration with Trip Itinerary
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a complete workflow that enables travelers to discover relevant tours, view detailed information, and add selected tours to their trip itinerary with proper lead generation tracking.
# Details:
This task involves creating a seamless tour discovery and integration system with the following components:

1. Tour Discovery Interface:
   - Create a searchable and filterable tour listing page that displays available tours based on location, date range, price, and tour type
   - Implement geolocation-based recommendations that match tours to the traveler's existing itinerary destinations
   - Design an intuitive card-based UI for tour listings with key information (image, title, duration, price, rating)

2. Tour Detail Page:
   - Develop a comprehensive tour detail page showing full descriptions, itinerary, inclusions/exclusions, cancellation policy, and reviews
   - Include an image gallery and map integration showing tour locations
   - Display dynamic availability and pricing based on selected dates and group size

3. "Add to Trip" Functionality:
   - Implement an "Add to Trip" button on both listing and detail pages
   - Create a modal for confirming tour details (date, time, number of participants) before adding to trip
   - Develop the backend integration to properly associate the tour with the user's existing itinerary
   - Ensure proper handling of tour timing conflicts with existing itinerary items

4. Lead Generation:
   - Implement tracking for all tour views, detail page visits, and "Add to Trip" actions
   - Create a lead notification system for tour operators when travelers show interest
   - Develop an API integration with the tour operator's booking system for availability checks
   - Store lead data in the CRM with proper attribution

5. User Experience Considerations:
   - Implement loading states and error handling throughout the flow
   - Create success/confirmation messages after adding tours
   - Design mobile-responsive interfaces for all components
   - Ensure accessibility compliance throughout the implementation

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify the complete tour discovery and integration workflow:

1. Functional Testing:
   - Verify tour listings load correctly with accurate information
   - Test all filters and search functionality with various parameters
   - Confirm tour detail pages display all required information
   - Validate that the "Add to Trip" flow correctly adds tours to the itinerary
   - Test handling of edge cases (unavailable tours, timing conflicts)

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify proper data flow between frontend components and backend services
   - Test API integrations with tour operator systems for availability and booking
   - Confirm lead data is correctly captured and stored in the CRM
   - Validate that tour operators receive proper notifications

3. User Flow Testing:
   - Create test scenarios covering the complete user journey from discovery to adding tours
   - Test different user personas (first-time users, returning users, users with existing trips)
   - Verify proper state management throughout the multi-step process

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and optimize load times for tour listings and detail pages
   - Test system performance with large datasets of tours
   - Verify responsive design works across different devices and screen sizes

5. A/B Testing:
   - Implement tracking to compare conversion rates between different UI variations
   - Measure the effectiveness of recommendation algorithms in driving tour bookings

Acceptance Criteria:
- Users can discover tours relevant to their trip destinations
- Tour detail pages provide comprehensive information needed for decision-making
- Tours can be successfully added to trip itineraries
- Lead generation data is accurately captured and routed to tour operators
- The entire flow works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices
