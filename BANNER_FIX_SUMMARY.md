# Banner Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
- **Date**: January 11, 2025
- **Production URL**: https://travel-itinerary-builder-n1zbf8utd-the-prompt-shop.vercel.app

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Unwanted Banners on Landing Page
The landing page was showing three intrusive banners:
- **GeolocationBanner** - Requesting location permissions
- **BatteryStatusBanner** - Showing battery saving mode
- **OrientationBanner** - Showing device orientation changes

These banners were inappropriate for the landing page and created a poor user experience.

### 2. Solution Implemented

#### ClientAppShell.tsx Changes
- Added pathname detection using `usePathname()` hook
- Created a `shouldShowBanners` condition that excludes banners on:
  - Homepage (`/`)
  - Onboarding pages (`/onboarding/*`)
  - Documentation (`/docs`)
  - Admin pages (`/admin`)

```typescript
const shouldShowBanners = !['/', '/onboarding', '/docs', '/admin'].some(path => 
  pathname === path || pathname.startsWith('/onboarding/')
)
```

- Conditionally rendered banners only when appropriate:
```typescript
{shouldShowBanners && (
  <>
    <OrientationBanner />
    <BatteryStatusBanner />
    <GeolocationBanner />
  </>
)}
```

### 3. Additional Cleanup

#### Fixed TypeScript Errors
- Removed unused imports in `app/page.tsx`:
  - `useRef`
  - `useScroll`
  - `useTransform`
  - `useTripContext`
  - `Compass`
  - `Luggage`
  - `MapPin`
- Removed unused variables:
  - `FeatureCard` component (unused after refactoring)
  - `trips` from context
  - `heroOpacity`, `heroScale`, `heroY` (unused scroll animations)
  - `heroRef`

## Result

The landing page now displays cleanly without intrusive banners, while still maintaining these features on appropriate pages where they add value (like trip planning and customization pages).

### Pages Where Banners Are Hidden:
- `/` (Homepage)
- `/onboarding` (All onboarding flows)
- `/docs` (Documentation)
- `/admin` (Admin pages)

### Pages Where Banners Still Show:
- `/trips` (Trip management)
- `/plan` (Trip planning)
- `/trips/[id]/details` (Trip details)
- Other feature pages where location/battery/orientation awareness is useful

## Technical Notes

- The OfflineStatusBanner is still shown globally as it's critical for user awareness
- The solution uses Next.js App Router's `usePathname()` for route detection
- No breaking changes were introduced
- All existing functionality remains intact
