# Lead Generation Popup - Fixes Applied

## Changes Made

### 1. Added "Skip for now" button
- Users can now skip the popup without providing an email
- Skip is remembered for 7 days

### 2. Fixed persistence after email submission
- When email is submitted, it's immediately stored in localStorage
- Popup won't show again if email has been provided
- No delay in closing after submission

### 3. Improved popup behavior
- Increased initial delay to 90 seconds (was 45 seconds)
- Increased scroll threshold to 70% (was 60%)
- Better tracking of shown/converted status

### 4. Added proper close handling
- Clicking X or outside the popup properly tracks as shown
- Prevents immediate re-display after closing

## Testing the Fixes

### To reset popup state (for testing):
Run this in the browser console:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('lead_popup_converted');
localStorage.removeItem('lead_popup_email');
localStorage.removeItem('lead_popup_last_shown');
localStorage.removeItem('lead_popup_skipped');
localStorage.removeItem('lead_popup_skip_time');
```

Or visit: http://localhost:3000/api/leads/reset

### Expected Behavior:
1. **First visit**: Popup shows after 90 seconds OR 70% scroll OR exit intent
2. **After email submission**: Popup never shows again
3. **After "Skip for now"**: Popup won't show for 7 days
4. **After closing (X button)**: Popup won't show for 24 hours

## localStorage Keys Used:
- `lead_popup_converted` - Set to 'true' when email is submitted
- `lead_popup_email` - Stores the submitted email
- `lead_popup_last_shown` - Timestamp of last display
- `lead_popup_skipped` - Set to 'true' when skipped
- `lead_popup_skip_time` - Timestamp when skipped
