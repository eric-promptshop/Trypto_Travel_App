# API Consolidation Summary

## ✅ Completed API Structure Consolidation

The API structure has been successfully consolidated from versioned (v1/v2) to a unified, feature-based structure.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **Directory Structure Changes**

**Before:**
```
/app/api/
├── v1/
│   ├── trips/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── roles/
│   ├── deploy/
│   ├── domains/
│   └── crm/
└── v2/
    └── generate-itinerary/
```

**After:**
```
/app/api/
├── trips/              # Core trip management
├── trips-ai/           # AI-enhanced features
│   └── generate/
├── content/            # Content management
├── crm/                # CRM integrations
├── admin/              # Admin features
│   ├── roles/
│   ├── deploy/
│   ├── domains/
│   ├── clients/
│   └── themes/
├── form-chat/          # AI form chat
└── extract-form-data/  # AI data extraction
```

#### 2. **Updated References**

All references throughout the codebase have been updated:

- **Hooks:**
  - `hooks/use-trips.tsx` - Updated 5 references
  - `hooks/use-itinerary.tsx` - Updated 7 references

- **Components:**
  - `components/admin/RoleManagement.tsx` - Updated 4 references
  - `components/admin/ContentManagement.tsx` - Updated 4 references
  - `components/onboarding/WhiteLabelOnboarding.tsx` - Updated 9 references

- **API Client:**
  - `lib/api/trips-client.ts` - Updated base URL

- **Tests:**
  - `tests/playwright/multi-tenant.spec.ts` - Updated 5 references
  - `tests/load/stress-test.yml` - Updated 2 references

- **Configuration:**
  - `vercel.json` - Updated function path for AI endpoint

#### 3. **API Route Comments**

Updated all API route comments to reflect new paths:
- Changed `/api/v1/trips` to `/api/trips`
- Changed `/api/v1/content` to `/api/content`
- Changed `/api/v1/roles` to `/api/admin/roles`
- Changed `/api/v1/deploy` to `/api/admin/deploy`
- Changed `/api/v1/domains` to `/api/admin/domains`
- Changed `/api/v1/crm` to `/api/crm`

### Benefits Achieved:

1. **Clearer Organization** - Feature-based structure instead of version-based
2. **No Version Confusion** - Single source of truth for each API
3. **Better Maintainability** - Related endpoints grouped together
4. **AI Features Separated** - Clear distinction between core and AI features
5. **Admin APIs Grouped** - All admin functions under `/api/admin`

### Next Steps:

1. **Update AI Integration** - Connect frontend components to use the consolidated AI endpoints
2. **Test All Endpoints** - Verify all APIs work correctly in their new locations
3. **Update Documentation** - Ensure API docs reflect the new structure
4. **Monitor for Issues** - Watch for any missed references during testing

### Important Notes:

- The Datadog external API reference in `monitoring/metrics/route.ts` was preserved
- All file moves were successful with no data loss
- Linting completed successfully with only warnings (no errors)
- The v1 deploy endpoint was kept as it had more complete implementation

This consolidation sets a clean foundation for properly integrating AI features into the frontend components.
